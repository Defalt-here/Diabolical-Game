A text based thriller played completely on command prompt console
Welcome to Diabolical Beta(V1.3)
(Trigger warning: Flashing lights)

---------------------------By Aditya Ranjan------------------------------

If you are reading this you are one of the first to be the play tester of this game. You are probably from my
class or my home. So I am highly grateful.

--------------------------------WARNING----------------------------------

Never in any case should you input anything else than an integer. No symbols or letters. The game has certain
points where it will ask you to input alphabets, only then should you add alphabets. Otherwise you will freak
the code out.

--------------------------What is Diabolical-----------------------------

Diabolical is a text based thriller game made in C. Go through the various directories and files to uncover the 
mystery of Diab and M4iN. Set foot in to the twisted text based User Interface to find out what happened 
"That Night".

-------------------------Become a detective------------------------------

Check every nook and corner to find riddles, clued and hints that are sprawled accross the files. Decode the codes
and uncover the mystery behind the ever chilling antics of diab? Who is Diab though?

-----------------------------Why me?-------------------------------------

You are basically a playtester and probably have my contact, go through the game to point out what is good and what
can be improved (basically a review), also please report any bugs and glitches that you come accross. You have a 
responsibility over this project and I count on you to get this done.

-----------------------Doubts and questions-----------------------------

If you want to know more about the code, or a particular feature and how I implemented it or just want to hear me
nerd out about C in general and make my day, Feel free to ask!

Thank You

(P.S. Take your time to go through the game, but consider that I will be waiting for your reviews, to make it
better.)
